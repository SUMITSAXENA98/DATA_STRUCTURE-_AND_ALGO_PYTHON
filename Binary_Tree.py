A Binary tree is a finite sets of nodes that is 
--> either empty or 
--> consists of a distinguished node known as root and remaining nodes are partitioned
 into two disjoint sets T1 and T2 and both of them are binary trees.
 T1 is called left subtree
 T2 is called right subtree

 PROPERTIES :
 -->Maximum number of nodes on any level i is 2i where i>=0
 -->In binary tree of heigt h,maximum no. of nodes possible is 2^h-1
 -->in binary tree of height h,minimun number of nodes possible is h 
 -->for a binary tree with a nodes,maximum height possible is n ,minimun heiht possoble is [log(n+1)]
 height can't be more than n--there should be at least one node at every level
from prop2--if height is h, max nodes possible is 2^h-1
--> in a non empty binary tree if n=number of nodes 
e=number of edges 
then e=n-1
every node has exactly one parent except root node n-1 nodes have exactly one parent .Their is one btw parent and child.
--> in a non empty binary tree 
if no=number of nodes with no child 
n2=no. of nodes with 2 children then n0=n2+1
