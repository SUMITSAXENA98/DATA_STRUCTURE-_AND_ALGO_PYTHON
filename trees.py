TREE --> non linear data structure 
a tree structure represent hierarchical releationship among elements 

NODE ----> each element in tree is called Node 
Edge ----> lines connecting the Node
Parent Node ---> immediate predeccor of Node
child node ----> immediate successor of Node 
Root node ----> specially designated node that does not have any parent 
leaf node ----> node that does not have any child 
level ---> distance of that node from root 
height  ----> total no. of levels in tree 
siblings  ---> two or more node which have same parent 
path ----> srequence of nodes n1,n2 ....nx ,such that each node ni is parent of ni+1 for 1<i<=x 
ancestor --->  node na is ancestor of node nx if na lies in unique path from root node to nx 
descendent ----> if node na is ancestor of node nx,then node nx is ecendent of node na
subtree --->
degree ----> no. of subtree or children of node
forest ----> a forest is set of n disjont trees where n>=0

defination of tree :
-- >A tree has a finite set of nodes such that :
1. there is a distinguished node called root 
2. remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0 disjoint sets T1,T2,...TN where each of these sets in a tree.
the sets T1,T2,...Tn are subtrees of root.
